# Important Info
1. This repository is a Unity project. The main scene is <code>navigation-demo</code>.

2. It is missing <code>starmap_16k.tif</code>, which is a skybox texture larger than 100MB (aka not allowed on GitHub). To make the project run correctly, <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a003800/a003895/starmap_16k.tif">download the picture</a> and import it to the project as a cubemap. Lastly, put it in the empty slot in <code>SkyboxBlended.shader</code>.
